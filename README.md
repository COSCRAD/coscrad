## About this Repo

We have adopted the monorepo approach to allow our members to maximize opportunities for code sharing and collaboration, while maintaining autonomy and focus on their own individual projects within this workspace.

### Technical

This monorepo workspace is managed using [Nx](https://nx.dev). See the `README` in an individual app or lib to learn more about the tools used on that particular project.

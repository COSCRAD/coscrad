     * - Use [o,model[target].length], where model[target] is the value of the
     * target string property on the associated model for the entire text field
     * to be used as context.
     *     - Con- you need to update this if the string length is updated
     * - Have a symbol \ constant string 'entire'
     * - Make this property optional
     *     - Cons- bad practice. It's better to have a symbol or special string
     *        constant so you are certain \ acting with intent.
     *  - Have a separate context type for this case

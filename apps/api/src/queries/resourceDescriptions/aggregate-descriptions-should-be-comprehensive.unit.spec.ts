/**
 * We could check this statically by instead using a mapped type for `AggregateInfo`.
 * However, this is more awkward to work with for the client. So we assert here
 * that there is one entry for every aggregate type.
 *
 * In the future, the best way to go is to use magic keys in the internal
 * source-of-truth representation and have a thin layer that maps these
 * to the public API format. This would render the present test unnecessary,
 * and provider faster feedback for devs.
